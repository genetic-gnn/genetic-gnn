# Genetic-evolutionary Graph Nerual Networks: A Paradigm for Improved Graph Representation Learning  

<br>
This is the official implementation for the paper "Genetic-evolutionary Graph Nerual Networks: A Paradigm for Improved Graph Representation Learning" 

### Preparation
The enviroment is created following [LRGB: Long Range Graph Benchmark](https://github.com/vijaydwivedi75/lrgb)

Run the following command to experiment on PascalVOC for node classification:

```
python main --cfg configs/vocsuperpixels-GPS.yaml --repeat 1 seed 0 wandb.use False
```
